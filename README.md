The idea behind our project is to bring people together through films.

This will be a platform that will consist of a main page that will host movies and a personal page.

The personal page contains your profile, a list of friends and a list of favorite films. You also have the opportunity to create a room where you can watch a movie with your friend or friends.

While watching a movie, you can chat or turn on the video and microphone.

You can also book a time to watch a movie with your friend by sending him a request and adding it to your calendar.
